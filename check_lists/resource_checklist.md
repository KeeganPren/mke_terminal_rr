# Resrouce Checklist
1. How much time (and energy) do you really have to work on the layout?  If you have a young family, a career, that demands many hours, and several kids in little league, that should be factored in before biting off a huge scope.

2. What construction skills do you have now?  What skills do you expect or want to acquire in the short term?

3. How long will you be living in the current location?  If you expect to be moving in the next year or two, you should focus on a design that can be built in that short time period.

4. How much space do you have?  Do you want to use all or some of it?

5. What is your attention span for a given layout project?  Two Years?  Five Years?  Ten Years?  If you tend for find new themes that interest you every several years, factor that in.

6. How much money do you have to spend (or want to spend) on the project?  The beauty of small switching layoutsis that they can be designed in such a way that they are affordable for any budget right down to the young student working a part time job.

7. If you want to model a specific prototype will you be able to get enough of the necessary information with out getting bogged down looking for it?
