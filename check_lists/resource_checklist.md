# Resrouce Checklist
1. How much time (and energy) do you really have to work on the layout?  If you have a young family, a career, that demands many hours, and several kids in little league, that should be factored in before biting off a huge scope.
  * Between work and the kids I can only realistically give a few hours a week at best, including weekends.
  * The amount of time that can be given on weekends will fluctuate with various other projects that need to be completed on the house.

2. What construction skills do you have now?  What skills do you expect or want to acquire in the short term?
  * I easily possess the required constructions skills for the construction of benchwork.
  * Any construction skills I hope to acquire will be developed by working on the house rather than the model railroad.

3. How long will you be living in the current location?  If you expect to be moving in the next year or two, you should focus on a design that can be built in that short time period.
  * We will likely be living in this house for some time.
  * However even if there are no plans to move, based on how long past prjects have taken a modular or incremental design would be desireable.

4. How much space do you have?  Do you want to use all or some of it?
  * I could potentially use the entire work room in the basement.
  * Since the work room still needs to be a viable workshop for house projects the room must be kept relatively clear
  * An around the walls design would be the best in order to avoid obstructing the interior of the room.

5. What is your attention span for a given layout project?  Two Years?  Five Years?  Ten Years?  If you tend for find new themes that interest you every several years, factor that in.
  * I have been very committed to modeling Milwaukee.
  * I have also been committed to the modern era maybe going back only as far as the 80s.

6. How much money do you have to spend (or want to spend) on the project?  The beauty of small switching layoutsis that they can be designed in such a way that they are affordable for any budget right down to the young student working a part time job.
  * For the size of layout that I am able to manage the pace at which work will proceed budget will not likely be a factor.

7. If you want to model a specific prototype will you be able to get enough of the necessary information with out getting bogged down looking for it?
  * Since I plan on modeling the modern era information regarding the current rail scene in Milwaukee is readily available.
  * There are a number of online forums dedicated to the South Eastern Wisconsin rail scene as well.
  * Since the locations are all near home, I will be able to visit specific sites and get my own photos.
