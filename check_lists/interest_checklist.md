# Interest Checklist
1. Which aspect of model railroading interests you the most: operations, structures, rolling stock, scenery, or all equally?
  * I really enjoy structures and rolling stock.
  * Operations is a secondary interest, in that I don't mind just moving cars around, but if I want to complete a switch list once in a while it would be nice to have actual industries and car spots to work with.
  * Scenery I find frustrating, I want it detailed, but don't have a lot of experience working on it.

2. What era appeals to you the most?  Have you done an immediate leap to the steam-to-diesel transition era and been overly quick to dismiss other eras which you might enjoy more?  Have you taken a hard look at the many benefits of modeling the modern era?
  * I'm definitely into modeling the modern era.
  * The earliest I'd go is to the last 80s since there are vague memories of the Chicago Northwestern and Milwaukee Road around home.

3. What theme appeals to you most?  (geographic location, a specific railroad, etc.)  In my experience we often make a quick jump here.  Have you examined all of the possibilities that are available to you?  If you are stuck, ask around for ideas.
  * I'm most attached to the location.  I want it to represent home.
  * Making it resemble home but not so obviously Milwaukee would be nice to I can change out motive power for some of the Chicago/Indiana roads like BRC, IHD, South Shore Line, etc.
  * There are a handful of themes that I could work with.  The [list of themes]("theme_list.md") has been identified with its pros and cons.

4. In terms of operations which do you enjoy the most: yard classification, industry spotting, or a mix?  Maybe you just want some casual shuttling back and forth.  Some people don't need any operations at all and just want a diorama with some movement.
  * I mostly like industrial switching.
  * Having a yard to make up trains for a local would be nice, but space may be an issue.
  * Having extra tracks on the mainline to display static trains for display would be nice.

5. If you are interested in operations, how many people do you want to operate with you?  Be realistic, in most cases it will be you alone.  How long do you want a session to last?
  * Operating sessions will almost always be single operator.
  * Maybe Jude will help once in a while.

6. Do you enjoy building commercial kits more or do you enjoy scratch building?  It makes a big difference.  Scratch building allows for more design flexibility since you can adjust the structure footprint to your needs.
  * I'd like to improve my scratch building skills, but the available commercial kits usually meet my needs.
  * I'd really like to build the Freytag Foundry form Model Railroader magazine since it is based on a facility in Milwaukee.

7. Do you want a detailed layout or are you happy representing the various elements with representational stand-ins?
  * Since the layout will be small, I'd like to create highly detailed scenes.
  * Stand-ins would be temporary and ideally replaced with detailed models.

8. Do you want an exact replica of a real location, a general representation of an actual area, or will you freelance and area?
  * Space will not allow for an exact replica, but being able to give the impression of certain specific locations would be good.
  * Areas to use for inspiration include, the Menominee River swing bridge, the 5th Ward, WSOR's North Milwaukee yard.
