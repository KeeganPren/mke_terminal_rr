1. Which aspect of model railroading interests you the most: operations, structures, rolling stock, scenery, or all equally?

2. What era appeals to you the most?  Have you done an immdiate leap to the steam-to-diesel transition era and been overly quick to dismiss other eras which you might enkoy more?  Have you taken a hard look at the many benefits of modeling the modern era?

3. What theme appeals to you most?  (geographic location, a specific railroad, etc.)  In my experience we often make a quick jump here.  Have you examined all of the possibilities that are available to you?  If you are stuck, ask around for ideas.

4. In terms of operations which do you enjoy the most: yard classification, industry spotting, or a mix?  Maybe you just want some casual shuttling back and forth.  Some people don't need any operations at all and just want a dioramam with some movement.

5. If you are interested in operations, how many people do you want to operate with you?  Be realistic, in most cases it will be you alone.  How long do you want a session to last?

6. Do you enjoy building commercial kits more or do you enjoy scratch building?  It makes a big difference.  Scratch building allows for more design flexibility since you can adjust the structure footprint to your needs.

7. Do you want a detailed layout or are you happy representing the various elements with representational stand-ins?

8. Do you want an exact replica of a real location, a general representation of an actual area, or will you freelance and area?
