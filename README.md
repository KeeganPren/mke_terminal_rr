# Overview
Welcome to the Milwaukee Terminal Railroad.

## Scope
The Milwaukee Terminal Railroad is loosely based on Milwaukee.  Specifically it is modeled after the area around what is currently the Wisconsin and Southern railroad's North Milwaukee Yard and the area around the 5th Ward and Downtown.  The focus is local switching of industries in the area.

Despite being based on Milwaukee the secenes are being designed to be generic enough to represent any rust belt city during the modern era.  This will allow me to model a variety modern railroads such as the Belt Railway of Chicago, Indiana Harbor Belt, Soo, Union Pacific, etc.
