# Overview
Welcome to the Milwaukee Terminal Railroad.

## Background
The Milwaukee Terminal Railroad is loosely based on Milwaukee.  Specifically it is modeled after the area around what is currently the Wisconsin and Southern railroad's North Milwaukee Yard and the area around the 5th Ward and Downtown including the Port of Milwaukee.  The focus is local switching of industries in the area.

Despite being based on Milwaukee the scenes are being designed to be generic enough to represent any rust belt city during the modern era.  This will allow me to model a variety modern railroads such as the Belt Railway of Chicago, Indiana Harbor Belt, Soo, Union Pacific, etc.

If possible, I'd like to accommodate some passenger trains.  I love Metra and the urban commuter stations.  This is a secondary goal as space will be tight and passenger equipment and facilities may consume a lot of space.

## Additional Notes
So why is this on GitHub?  Well, as an experiment really.  As many people have embraced CAD for designing model railroads taking advantage of a revision control system seems like a natural step.  Also being a software engineer by training, I can't help it.

I'm also working directly from the design methodology outlined in [Lance Mindheim's book](https://lancemindheim.com/book-store/) How To Design A Small Switching Layout.  This is where all of the checklists come from, as well as some of the notes that reflect various design considerations come from.  As a novice layout designer this has been a helpful template for making sure I consider all of the various aspects of layout design.

Do you think model railroaders will embrace this?  Not really.  Tools like this are built for software developers.  Unless you are familiar with certain development concepts and have a certain proficiency and comfort using certain computer tools using git to manage a model railroad design project may feel incredibly awkward.  If this gains some traction in the model railroad community cool, if not, oh well it works for me...
