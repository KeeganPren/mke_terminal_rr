#Industries
The following notes are regarding my selection of industries for the layout.

##Considerations
The following questions address some considerations that effect the selection of industries for the layout.
* Are you primarily interested in the operational potential of a specific industry with architectural charm being secondary?
* Do you want to model specific prototype structures with architectural charm being irrelevant?
* Is the appearance of the industrial structure more important to you than its operational potential?  In other words do you want an architectural diorama with some train motion built in?
* Do you want the best of both worlds?  By this I mean do you want structures that have a lot of operational potential but are also interesting visually?
* Do you want to limit your structures to commercial kits or will you be scratch building or kit bashing structures?  Sticking solely to commercially available kits will require you to limit yourself to the predefined shape that comes in the box.  Scratch building allows more planning flexibility.

For my purposes, structures and industries that are representative of the region and era are the most important consideration.  I am willing to scratch build or kit bash if needed.  It will not be necessary to copy prototype structures which will give me a little more flexibility.  While I want to the layout to support operations visual interest is more important to me.  I want to make sure the layout "feels" like Milwaukee more than being operationally challenging.
