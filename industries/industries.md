#Industry Selection
The following notes are regarding my selection of industries for the layout.

##Considerations
The following questions address some considerations that effect the selection of industries for the layout.
* Are you primarily interested in the operational potential of a specific industry with architectural charm being secondary?
* Do you want to model specific prototype structures with architectural charm being irrelevant?
* Is the appearance of the industrial structure more important to you than its operational potential?  In other words do you want an architectural diorama with some train motion built in?
* Do you want the best of both worlds?  By this I mean do you want structures that have a lot of operational potential but are also interesting visually?
* Do you want to limit your structures to commercial kits or will you be scratch building or kit bashing structures?  Sticking solely to commercially available kits will require you to limit yourself to the predefined shape that comes in the box.  Scratch building allows more planning flexibility.

For my purposes, structures and industries that are representative of the region and era are the most important consideration.  I am willing to scratch build or kit bash if needed.  It will not be necessary to copy prototype structures which will give me a little more flexibility.  While I want to the layout to support operations visual interest is more important to me.  I want to make sure the layout "feels" like Milwaukee more than being operationally challenging.

##Local Industries
The following is a selection of local industries that can serve as inspiration for the industries to be modeled on the layout.  Each industry is presented with brief description as well as some pros and cons of using that industry on the layout.

1. Hansen Storage - Not very interesting architecturally, but compact and served by modern boxcars for paper warehousing
2. Miller Compressing - easy to model, relatively compact
3. Wayne Pigments - great candidate to put on a layout, compact and makes use of multiple car types (tankcar and boxcar)
4. TSI - served by interesting loads on flat cars, they repair retarders and other track components
5. Badger Mining (gone) - Mostly interesting in historical context, served by covered hoppers and one of my first memories of WSOR
6. Cargil - cool port scene, mostly salt service, 40' hoppers are short so more of them fit on the layout
7. LaFarge Cement - another port industry, simple facility to model and also uses the shorter 40' hoppers
8. Talgo - may be too big to put on my layout, but would be an interesting way to model passenger equipment
9. Bliffert - receives lumber and building material in boxcars and centerbeam flatcars
10. Northern Railcar - ran a wheel shop which made for some interesting loads of railcar wheels and occasional gondolas of scrap
11. Elementis Chemical - Architecturally the chemical plants are interesting to look at and they are typically served by smaller tankcars
12. Benz Oil - industrial lubricant company receives 50' tank cars, sits at a location that I remember as a kid back when it was served by Soo Line
13. Moore Oil - Another industrial lubricant distributor compact and easy to model
14. Solenis (Ashland Chemical) - A larger chemical plant, architecturally maybe interesting to look at, but may be too big
