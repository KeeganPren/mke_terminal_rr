#Scenery Only Zones
The following notes provide some more detail and rationale for the layout of the scenery only zones.

The large scenery only zone near the center of the layout is reserved for the swing bridge and the river front.  I'd like to include the adjacent corner to extend the scene.  This scene has limited placement due to the bridge and the size of the scene.

The area at the end of the short leg of the layout is reserved for a highway overpass that will conceal the end of the staging yard.

The other scenery zones are in place to divide the layout into a couple of switching areas.  There is a lot of flexibility with the placement of those areas.
